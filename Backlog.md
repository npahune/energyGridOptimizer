Here's a **detailed Agile Backlog** with **Epics and associated User Stories** based on your **Energy Grid Load Optimizer (EGLO)** PRD and sprint plan. This structure helps your team prioritize, develop, and deliver iteratively‚Äîespecially useful if you're managing in **Jira**, **ClickUp**, **Trello**, or **Notion**.

## üß± EPIC 1: System Setup & Data Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish the foundational database schema and integrate with Supabase.

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 1.1:

**As a developer, I want to define the Supabase schema, so that energy data can be stored and queried efficiently.**

* Tasks:

  * Design and create tables: `locations`, `energy_loads`, `energy_sources`, `battery_states`, etc.
  * Enable relationships and foreign keys
  * Create indexes on timestamps and location\_ids

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 1.2:

**As a data engineer, I want to seed initial data for locations and energy sources, so the optimization APIs can be tested.**

* Tasks:

  * Insert test locations with mock geo-coordinates
  * Add sources: grid, solar, battery with pricing/emission data

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 1.3:

**As a developer, I want to connect the Supabase client to my backend, so the APIs can store and retrieve data.**

* Tasks:

  * Configure Supabase client in backend (FastAPI/Flask)
  * Write helper functions for CRUD operations

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è EPIC 2: Forecasting Engine (QNN or Fallback ML)

**Goal:** Predict short-term energy load per location using historical patterns.

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 2.1:

**As a system operator, I want to forecast energy demand using past data, so I can plan resource usage.**

* Tasks:

  * Load historical usage + weather data
  * Implement QNN scaffold or ML fallback model
  * Predict 1‚Äì24 hour horizon

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 2.2:

**As a developer, I want a REST API `/forecast` that returns load predictions per location and hour.**

* Tasks:

  * Build and expose `/forecast` endpoint
  * Validate inputs: location, time range
  * Return JSON with forecasted `load_kw`

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 2.3:

**As a data scientist, I want to log model predictions and actuals, so I can evaluate model accuracy.**

* Tasks:

  * Store predicted vs actual in `qnn_forecast_logs`
  * Track error metrics like MAPE

---

## ‚ö° EPIC 3: Grid Switching Optimization

**Goal:** Provide smart switching decisions between energy sources to reduce cost and emissions.

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 3.1:

**As a grid manager, I want to optimize energy source switching based on cost and availability.**

* Tasks:

  * Implement basic switching logic (greedy / rule-based)
  * Read from `energy_sources` + price table

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 3.2:

**As a developer, I want a REST API `/optimize-switching` that returns a source schedule.**

* Tasks:

  * Accept location and forecasted demand as input
  * Return JSON switching plan for next 24h
  * Store output in `grid_switch_plans`

---

## üîã EPIC 4: Battery Storage Optimization

**Goal:** Optimize battery usage to enhance efficiency and lifespan.

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 4.1:

**As a battery operator, I want to generate a charge/discharge plan based on load and cost.**

* Tasks:

  * Use simple rules or QNN model
  * Consider charge level, capacity, degradation

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 4.2:

**As a developer, I want a REST API `/optimize-battery` that returns a schedule of battery actions.**

* Tasks:

  * Accept battery state and forecasted load
  * Return time-series charge/discharge plan
  * Log results in `battery_states`

---

## üß™ EPIC 5: Testing & Evaluation

**Goal:** Ensure quality, correctness, and observability of the system.

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 5.1:

**As a QA engineer, I want unit tests for each endpoint, so I can verify correct behavior.**

* Tasks:

  * Write tests for forecast, switching, battery endpoints
  * Validate schema, response codes

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 5.2:

**As a system evaluator, I want to calculate the accuracy of forecasts, so I can measure model performance.**

* Tasks:

  * Compare predicted vs. actuals
  * Auto-generate MAPE or RMSE reports

---

## üìà EPIC 6: DevOps & Deployment

**Goal:** Make the prototype available and usable for demos or testing.

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 6.1:

**As a developer, I want to deploy the API backend online, so I can demo it easily.**

* Tasks:

  * Use Render, Railway, or Docker
  * Connect to Supabase from deployed app

---

### ‚úÖ User Story 6.2:

**As a stakeholder, I want a Swagger/OpenAPI interface or basic UI, so I can explore the system quickly.**

* Tasks:

  * Enable FastAPI Swagger docs
  * Optionally build a small Streamlit UI
