## üìò Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### üìå Product Name:

**Energy Grid Load Optimizer (EGLO)**

### üß© Objective:

Develop a rapid prototype of an intelligent energy grid load optimizer that leverages **Quantum Neural Network (QNN)** optimization to:

* **Forecast energy loads** (short-term predictions, e.g., hourly)
* **Optimize grid switching** based on forecast, availability, and demand
* **Improve battery storage utilization** across distributed energy resources

---

## 1. üîç Problem Statement

Energy providers face difficulty managing dynamic energy loads due to increasing demand, integration of renewables, and the distributed nature of modern power grids. Manual and rule-based optimization strategies are no longer sufficient to achieve real-time balancing, cost efficiency, and storage utilization.

---

## 2. üéØ Goals

* Use **QNN** to **forecast short-term energy loads** (next 1‚Äì24 hours)
* Optimize **switching decisions** between energy sources (grid, solar, battery, etc.)
* Maximize **battery storage** efficiency by adjusting charge/discharge cycles
* Deliver all insights via a **RESTful API** for real-time integration
