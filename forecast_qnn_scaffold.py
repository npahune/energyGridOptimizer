# QNN Forecasting Scaffold (Task 2.1)
# This is a placeholder for a QNN or fallback ML model for energy load forecasting.
# You can expand this with Qiskit, Pennylane, or scikit-learn as needed.

import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Dummy regression fallback for prototyping
def forecast_energy_load(history, weather, hours_ahead=24):
    # history: list of (timestamp, load_kw)
    # weather: list of (timestamp, temperature, ...)
    # Returns: list of (timestamp, forecast_load_kw)
    now = datetime.utcnow()
    base = np.mean([x[1] for x in history])
    forecasts = []
    for h in range(1, hours_ahead+1):
        # Simple sinusoidal + noise for demo
        load = base + 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * h / 24) + np.random.normal(0, 2)
        forecasts.append((now + timedelta(hours=h), round(load, 2)))

# Example usage:
# history = [(datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(hours=i), 100 + np.random.normal(0, 5)) for i in range(48)]
# weather = ...
# print(forecast_energy_load(history, weather))
