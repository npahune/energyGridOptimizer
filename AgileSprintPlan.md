Here’s a detailed **Agile Sprint Plan** (2-week sprint) for developing the **Energy Grid Load Optimizer (EGLO)** prototype based on the PRD and PostgreSQL/Supabase data model.

This sprint plan includes **stories, tasks, priorities, owners (optional), and time estimates**, aligned with your goal of rapid prototyping in a tight iteration loop.

## 🏃 Sprint 1 Plan: Energy Grid Load Optimizer (2 Weeks)

**Sprint Goal:** Deliver a working prototype with APIs for forecasting, grid switching, and battery optimization using QNN scaffolding and Supabase backend.

---

### 🔁 Sprint Duration:

**10 working days (2 weeks)**

---

### 📦 Product Backlog Items (User Stories)

---

#### **1. As a grid operator, I want to define locations and their energy sources, so that the system can localize optimization.**

* **Tasks:**

  * [ ] Create `locations`, `energy_sources` tables in Supabase
  * [ ] Seed data for 2–3 mock locations with solar/battery/grid mix
  * [ ] Setup Supabase REST API access or Supabase-js client

* **Estimate:** 1 day

* **Priority:** 🟩 High

---

#### **2. As a data scientist, I want to store and retrieve historical load and weather data, so the QNN model can make informed predictions.**

* **Tasks:**

  * [ ] Create `energy_loads` and `weather_data` tables
  * [ ] Import mock load/weather CSVs (or simulate with sinusoidal generator)
  * [ ] Connect Supabase to ingest sample time series

* **Estimate:** 1.5 days

* **Priority:** 🟩 High

---

#### **3. As a developer, I want an API that returns forecasted loads using QNN or fallback ML logic.**

* **Tasks:**

  * [ ] Scaffold FastAPI or Flask backend
  * [ ] Implement `/forecast` endpoint
  * [ ] Use dummy QNN (or regression model as placeholder)
  * [ ] Store results in `energy_loads` with `is_forecast = true`

* **Estimate:** 2 days

* **Priority:** 🟩 High

---

#### **4. As a system optimizer, I want the API to suggest switching decisions to minimize cost and emissions.**

* **Tasks:**

  * [ ] Create `grid_switch_plans` table
  * [ ] Implement `/optimize-switching` endpoint using greedy/cost-based logic
  * [ ] Read pricing and source data from Supabase
  * [ ] Return time-based switching plan

* **Estimate:** 1.5 days

* **Priority:** 🟨 Medium

---

#### **5. As a battery operator, I want an endpoint to suggest charge/discharge actions based on forecast and availability.**

* **Tasks:**

  * [ ] Create `battery_states` table
  * [ ] Implement `/optimize-battery` endpoint
  * [ ] Include constraints (e.g., capacity, charge rate)

* **Estimate:** 1.5 days

* **Priority:** 🟨 Medium

---

#### **6. As a QA engineer, I want unit tests and mock test data for API endpoints.**

* **Tasks:**

  * [ ] Use `pytest` or built-in test client
  * [ ] Write test cases for `/forecast`, `/optimize-switching`, `/optimize-battery`
  * [ ] Validate response schema and status codes

* **Estimate:** 1 day

* **Priority:** 🟨 Medium

---

#### **7. As a product owner, I want a minimal dashboard or Swagger/OpenAPI UI for demoing the prototype.**

* **Tasks:**

  * [ ] Enable Swagger docs via FastAPI
  * [ ] Optionally add Replit/Streamlit UI to display results
  * [ ] Deploy backend (Render/Vercel/Docker)

* **Estimate:** 1.5 days

* **Priority:** 🟦 Low

---

### 🔧 Technical & Architecture Tasks

* [ ] Supabase schema SQL file and auth rules (RLS disabled for dev)
* [ ] Basic logging and error handling
* [ ] Environment setup for quantum frameworks (Qiskit, Pennylane placeholder)

Would you like me to:

* Generate a **task board (Jira/Notion/Trello format)**?
* Provide **FastAPI starter code** with endpoint stubs and Supabase integration?
* Or generate **mock data CSVs** for load, weather, and battery simulation?

Let me know your next step.
